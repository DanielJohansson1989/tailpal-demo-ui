<h1>Concept of a digital passport for a pet</h1>
<p>
  This is the result of a school project where we were assigned to create a model of a pet passport for TailPal AB.<br/>
  Although we have created a web application, we have tried to make the layout resemble a smartphone as much as possible.
</p>
<h3>Features of the app:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A function where, by logging in through BankId, it retrieves data of the users registered pets based on Mina sidor on jordbruksverket.se.</li>
  <li>A timestamp to verify when the data was retrieved from jordbruksverket.</li>
  <li>The option to select which of the owned pets to display on the digital passport.</li>
  <li>In the passport view there is the functionality to toggle between showing data of the current pet and owner or the list of vaccines the pet has recieved.</li>
  <li>In the passport view the user can easily swipe with a finger to show the passport of the next pet if the user is traveling with multiple pets.</li>
</ul>
